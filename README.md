# Deep Learning From Scratch

The aim of this Repository is to create a common place for all the Deep Learning Models that I had written from scratch while learning Deep Learning following the mathematics behind them.

1. **A simple neural network** equivalent to a multi-class classifier. This notebook elaborates on how to write a simple neural netwok using only numpy. The use case is the publicly available  MNIST dataset :  https://github.com/vipuljoshi92/Deep_Learning_From_Scratch/blob/in_progress/Simple%20Neural%20Network.ipynb
